ReduceByKey uses combiner internally thus reducing the no of data that are being passed thr' the network.
GroubyKey doesnt use combiner and hence large chunk of data will transfered. So better use reduceByKey.
Groupbykey can be used for other purposes other than aggregate function whereas reducebykey can be used only for aggregation.

ReduceByKey and CombineByKey i/o and O/p should be same. AggregateByKey i/p and o/p can be different.
ReduceByKey Combiner and Reducer logic is same, CombineByKey reduce and combine logic can be different.

Spark RDD are immutable.
